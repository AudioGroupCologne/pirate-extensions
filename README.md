Adaptions to the PIRATE In-Ear Microphones

## Description
This repository contains supplementary materials for adapted in-ear microphones [1], based on the PIRATE microphones design by Denk et al. [2].

## Contents

You can find all the 3d files in the stl-fileformat ready to 3D print as well as a single blender scene containing all the objects in the pirate-models folder and its subfolders
